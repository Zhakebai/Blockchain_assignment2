# AI Model Marketplace dApp

The AI Model Marketplace is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to list, purchase, and rate AI models. The smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain (Holesky testnet), and the frontend interacts with it using Web3.js.

## Demo

Here are some screenshots and a demo of how the dApp works:

## Features

- **List a Model**: Creators can list their AI models for sale, specifying the model's name, description, and price.
- **Purchase a Model**: Users can purchase listed models by paying the specified price in Wei.
- **Rate a Model**: After purchasing, users can rate models on a scale of 1 to 5, which will be reflected in the modelâ€™s average rating.
- **Withdraw Funds**: Creators can withdraw the funds they earn from model sales.

## Technologies

- **Solidity**: Smart contracts are written in Solidity (v0.8.27).
- **Web3.js**: The frontend interacts with the Ethereum blockchain using Web3.js.
- **MetaMask**: Users interact with the dApp via MetaMask for Ethereum transactions.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The frontend is built using standard web technologies.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract is deployed on the Holesky Ethereum test network and includes the following key functions:

- `listModel`: Allows creators to list AI models for sale.
- `purchaseModel`: Enables users to purchase models and transfers funds to the creator.
- `rateModel`: Lets users rate the models they have purchased.
- `withdrawFunds`: Creators can withdraw their earnings from model sales.
